This repository hosts a SAST tool powered by  LLMs. It leverages AI and machine learning to detect security vulnerabilities in source code, providing accurate analysis.

## What does the project do?
SmartSast is a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) writen in Python code, to analyze different languange codes like () and detect potential security vulnerabilities. It identifies risks based on CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) patterns, using AI to provide smarter and more accurate results than traditional static scanners.

## Why is the project useful?
Unlike many SAST tools that run in the cloud or rely on static rules, SmartSast uses LLMs locally in Google Colab, giving developers and students a private, flexible, and AI-powered way to scan their code. It’s ideal for learning, testing, or working in secure environments where sending code to external servers is not an option. There's no need for complex setup or API keys — just open the Colab notebook and run it.

## How can users get started?
You can start using SmartSast immediately in Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-USERNAME/SmartSast/blob/main/smart_sast_colab.ipynb):

SmartSast runs directly in Google Colab with no installation required. Here's how to begin:
1. Click the “Open in Colab” badge at the top of this page.
2. Go to File → Save a copy in Drive to keep your own version
3. Follow the notebook instructions step-by-step.
4. Use the code samples provided in the sample/ folder, or paste your own Python code into the scanner.
5. Review the vulnerability analysis shown in the results.

✔ No installation required

✔ No API key needed

✔ Includes example code in the sample/ folder

>Note: A standalone local version may be available in the future.
