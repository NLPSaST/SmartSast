  "Description": "The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.",
  "ExtendedDescription": "\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n",

  "PotentialMitigations.0.Strategy": "Input Validation",
  "PotentialMitigations.0.Description": "\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\n",

Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.\n\n\nUse a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \"..\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:\n\n\n  - realpath() in C\n\n  - getCanonicalPath() in Java\n\n  - GetFullPath() in ASP.NET\n\n  - realpath() or abs_path() in Perl\n\n  - realpath() in PHP\n\n",

In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.\n\n\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.\n\n\nBe careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.\n",

Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.\n\n\nThis significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.\n",

The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.\n\n\nIf errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.\n\n\nAvoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.\n\n\nIn the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.\n",

The path is checked against an expected directory (/home/cwe/documents); otherwise, an attacker could provide relative path sequences like \"..\" to cause normpath() to generate paths that are outside the intended directory (CWE-23). By putting the pieces of the path string together in this fashion, the script avoids a call to os.path.join() and any potential issues that might arise if an absolute path is entered. With this version of the script, if the current working directory is /home/cwe/documents, and the user inputs /etc/passwd, the resulting path will be /home/cwe/documents/etc/passwd. The user is therefore contained within the current working directory as intended.",

  "MappingNotes.Usage": "Allowed",
  "MappingNotes.Rationale": "This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
  "MappingNotes.Comments": "Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.",
  "MappingNotes.Reasons.0": "Acceptable-Use",
  "Notes.0.Type": "Other",
  "Notes.0.Note": "In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.",
  "Notes.1.Type": "Relationship",
  "Notes.1.Note": "Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.",
  "Notes.2.Type": "Relationship",
  "Notes.2.Note": "Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).",
  "Notes.3.Type": "Terminology",
  "Notes.3.Note": "\n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n",
  "Notes.4.Type": "Research Gap",
  "Notes.4.Note": "Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.",
  "Notes.5.Type": "Research Gap",
  "Notes.5.Note": "\n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n",
